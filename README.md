Overview
=======

Adds rude, cruel, and hostile additions to the Minecraft world in a data driven and extensible manner. Inspired heavily by Don't Starve, Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and my faint memories of Thaumcraft. 

Features
=======

## Module 1: Fungocalypse - WIP  
Fungal spread, a mysterious stacking mushroom disease, and fatal consequences.  
Possible Features (nothing is guaranteed until it's in):  
- Mushroom variants of mobs, likely not directly hostile (unless it's a mushroom variant of an existing hostile mob) but instead contributes directly or indirectly to spreading.
- An underground extension of the mushroom fields. If anything is directly hostile, it should be down here.  
- Poison the fungus back! Harming potions should clear mycelium back to grass and turn mushrooms into a new wood type to replace the trees its consumed.
- Prune it with fire. Fire spread on fungal blocks should be cranked up to absurdly quick levels, mushroom blocks should be made flammable, and mycelium should burn away to dirt. In exchange, fire spread should be extremely toned down in Mushroom Fields to prevent just burning away a core part of the "hive." It should also use a special bespoke gated fire type.

## Module 2: The Sculk Bloom - Not Yet Started  
The not-so deep dark, a new surface biome full of sculk and demanding of the utmost quiet from travellers. One strike, you're out.
Possible Features:
- A new "super" sculk shrieker that summons wardens after only one strike. Should be clearly marked and visible on the surface.  
- Inverse kinematics animated "Watcher" that gazes out over the bloom and alerts at the presence of intruders.
