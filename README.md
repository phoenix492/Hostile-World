Overview
=======

Adds rude, cruel, and hostile additions to the Minecraft world in a data driven and extensible manner. Inspired heavily by Don't Starve, Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and my faint memories of Thaumcraft. 

Features

## Module 1: Fungocalypse - WIP  
Fungal spread, a mysterious stacking mushroom disease, and fatal consequences.  
Possible Features (nothing is guaranteed until it's in):  
- Mushroom variants of mobs, likely not directly hostile (unless it's a mushroom variant of an existing hostile mob) but instead contributes directly or indirectly to spreading.
- An underground extension of the mushroom fields. If anything is directly hostile, it should be down here.  
- Poison the fungus back! Harming potions should clear mycelium back to grass and turn mushrooms into a new wood type to replace the trees its consumed.
- Prune it with fire. The hive has a crippling weakness to fire, but normal flames don't seem to do the trick...

## Module 2: The Sculk Bloom - Not Yet Started  
The not-so deep dark, a new surface biome full of sculk and demanding of the utmost quiet from travellers. One strike, you're out.
Possible Features:
- A new "super" sculk shrieker that summons wardens after only one strike. Should be clearly marked and visible on the surface.  
- Inverse kinematics animated "Watcher" that gazes out over the bloom and alerts at the presence of intruders.
